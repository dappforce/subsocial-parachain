# Creator Staking Pallet

The Creator Staking pallet enables SUB token holders to support their favorite content creators, communities, and application builders by staking SUB tokens. Both parties (SUB stakers and creators) earn rewards based on the inflation of the SUB token.

## Features

- **Staking Information**: The pallet tracks staking information for creators by era, allowing backers to stake funds to their favorite creators.

- **Unstaking and Withdrawal**: Backers can start the unstaking process, and once the unstaking period has passed, they can withdraw their staked funds.

- **Reward Distribution**: The pallet calculates and distributes rewards for backers and creators on a periodic basis (e.g., per era), incentivizing participation in the ecosystem.
